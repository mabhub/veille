Comma d'habitude à chaque mise à jour de notre Gitlab, je parcours les notes de
mise à jour pour voir les nouveautés dont nous bénéficions à present.

- Gitlab 13.8
  - Plein de nouvelles choses pour faciliter l'utilisation des Pipelines :
    - [Pipeline editor](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#pipeline-editor)
    - [CI lint tool in the pipeline editor page](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#ci-lint-tool-in-the-pipeline-editor-page)

  - [Send an email to an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#send-an-email-to-an-issue)  
    > Chaque ticket dispose d'une adresse mail unique permettant d'ajouter un nouveau commentaire.  
    > Cela offre la possibilité, par exemple, de **transferer un mail client** plutôt que de devoir le copier/coller, ou encore de **joindre des fichiers**.
  - [Click and drag multiline merge request comments](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#click-and-drag-multiline-merge-request-comments)  
    > Commenter sur plusieurs lignes en *glissant*.
